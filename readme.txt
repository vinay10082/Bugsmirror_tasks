Dictionary Generator

In this task you have to develop a dictionary console tool in any programming language
of your interest. This tool will generate a file where the list of words and its
corresponding meaning are stored. The generated file will be in .txt format. This tool will
have the following features:
● Tool will generate a .txt formatted file in the current directory.
● Tool will take word-meaning input and store it in the .txt file.
● Tool will take the word as input and return the meaning after searching through the
.txt file.
● Tool will take the word as input and remove the word and its meaning from the .txt
file.
● Tool should be easy to use.


Constraints:
● Words with multiple meanings should be handled in such a way that no word is
present more than once in the .txt file.
● You can’t use any third party packages, you have to use only inbuilt functions
provided by the programming language.
